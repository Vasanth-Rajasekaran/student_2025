Stephen Curry, born on March 14, 1988, in Akron, Ohio, is a professional basketball player for the Golden State Warriors in the NBA. Known for his incredible shooting skills, Curry is especially famous for his ability to make three-pointers from long distances. He has set multiple records for the most three-pointers made in a season.

Curry's rise to fame wasn‚Äôt straightforward. Despite being overlooked by major colleges, he excelled at Davidson College, where he led his team to the Elite Eight in the 2008 NCAA Tournament. The Golden State Warriors drafted him 7th overall in the 2009 NBA Draft.

In the NBA, Curry has won multiple MVP awards (2015, 2016) and led the Warriors to several championships (2015, 2017, 2018). His style of play, with his deep shots and quick release, has changed how basketball is played, with many teams now focusing on three-point shooting.
